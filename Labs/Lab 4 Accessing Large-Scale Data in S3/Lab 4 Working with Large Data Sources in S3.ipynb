    "# Lab 4: Working with Large Data Sources in S3\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we're going to be working with two large public datasets that are hosted in S3: the [NYC Taxi dataset](https://registry.opendata.aws/nyc-tlc-trip-records-pds/) and [GDELT](https://registry.opendata.aws/gdelt/). We could theoretically download this data and work with it locally, but it is enormous and it is not practical to query and subset it on a local machine. It makes sense to work with the data in the AWS cloud, where it already lives. To this end, we will use Python's `boto3` library to run AWS Athena and S3 Select resources. With these resources, we can begin to access and understand these large datasets in a serverless capacity, without needing to set up database servers. We'll explore further methods for analyzing and fitting models on large-scale data in Weeks 7 and 8 when we learn more about Spark, but this should whet your appetite and help you see how you can use `boto3` to do large-scale cloud computing tasks within a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't already, please install the `boto3` package (via Anaconda, this can be achieved by running `conda install boto3` on the command line). The package will allow you to work with AWS resources using the credentials you have provided as a part of your AWS CLI configuration. So, you should confirm that these credentials are correct (recall that your AWS Educate session token changes every 3 hours) in order to ensure the code runs."

    "So, we seem to have a number of CSV files that fit this criteria. How do we actually see what's inside these files and begin to analyze it? First of all, we could assess the general content of a file by previewing the file. For instance, we could generate a url for the file in S3 and read only a subset of the CSV's rows into a Pandas DataFrame. You'll notice, though, that this takes a while to run (20 seconds for only 10 rows!). This strategy will not scale up very well for downloading large amounts of data locally."

    "One limitation to S3 Select, though, is that it can only search over and return a limited amount of data at one time. If you have larger queries you would like to perform (i.e. over many gigabytes or terabytes of data) on data in an S3 bucket, it would be better to use AWS Athena, which you can also access via the Boto3 Python package. Athena additionally allows you to run queries over all of the available files in the bucket being queried (for instance, over all of the Yellow Cab CSV files in the NYC Taxi Bucket).\n",
    "\n",
    "The only catch with Athena is that, before you can run any queries, you will need to specify your data schema -- how your data is structured and the data types that are used -- so that it knows how to read the data. After you have specified this information, Athena can run standard SQL queries in a serverless fashion. Alternatively, you can also use AWS Glue crawlers to discover the schematization for you if you want to abstract the process even further. We will not be using AWS Glue today, though, and will just manually specify the schema of our data (typically, this is already by defined for AWS' public datasets and does not require too much effort).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's transition over to another large public dataset on AWS for our work with Athena -- the Global Database of Events, Language and Tone (GDELT) Project. The project \"monitors the world’s broadcast, print, and web news from nearly every corner of every country in over 100 languages and identifies the people, locations, organizations, counts, themes, sources, emotions, quotes, images and events driving our global society every second of every day\" ([Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/gdelt/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's specify a function to run an Athena query using Boto3. Then, we'll establish our data's schema using the `create_db` and `create_table` queries. From here, we should be ready to begin learning more about the data itself in the GDELT bucket!"
